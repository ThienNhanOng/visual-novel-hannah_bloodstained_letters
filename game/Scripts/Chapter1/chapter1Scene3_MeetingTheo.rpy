    Theo "I’ve been digging into Hannah’s disappearance, and the evidence isn’t as thin as it first seemed. I assume you were suspecting something yourself."

    Theo "There’s something you don’t know—something I only just uncovered. During my investigation of another case, I found a photograph."

    Theo "I assume this person next to your sister looks familiar?"

    Theo "Not just friends, but coworkers at a jewelry company. The timestamp on the photo? Four weeks ago. That’s a full week before Hannah vanished... and two weeks before the arm was found."

    Theo "Mia’s more involved than you think. She isn’t just Hannah’s best friend. She’s part of the picture—a bigger piece of the puzzle."

    "I'm shocked. It's a picture of Hannah. And Mia... at what appears to be some sort of business event."
    "an auction house perhaps?"

    Theo "I was digging into an old case—classified, buried deep in shadows. But tonight, I think I’m willing to bend the rules, just this once, to bring light to the darkness."

    Theo "Your sister and Mia—they weren’t just friends. They were coworkers at a place called G.T. Jewelers, a place I'd describe as a world of glitter and danger."

    Theo "About a month ago, there was to be an auction—a rare treasure, a pure rose pink diamond pendant, a one of a kind with only 2 known in existence. The auction was set to be a grand event, at sea"

    Theo "But the day after the auction was set to begin, the diamond vanished into the night. Your sister and Mia were one of many names that participated in the grand event."

    Theo "The photo I found… it’s stamped four weeks and two days ago, at exactly 7:37 in the evening—just a week before Hannah disappearance."

    Theo "What Mia knows, I know not. Yet as cannon to Hannah's chronicle, to her she is yoked."
