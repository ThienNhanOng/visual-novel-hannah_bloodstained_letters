    "I took a moment to compose myself."

    Player "Thank you... and I'm sorry, but you are?"

    Theo "A single fold can change everything. I am the crease in your perfect paper world. I am the one that watches closely, as the story unfolds... one fold at a time."

    Theo "The name is Theo. Detective Theodor E. Harper Chapman."

    Player "Please make haste. I have a lot on my mind right now."
    Theo "Call me Theo. And it is not what you can do for me, but what I can do for you. Let's talk more in private."
