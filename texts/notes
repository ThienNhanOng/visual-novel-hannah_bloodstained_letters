------------------
hud/interactive map for school:

rooms:
coordinates for ui location
factory: creating a room
command: execute call/jump room and to check if entered or not
template: originally inherit predefined rooms but override.

shop:
facad
enum 
state of item (implicitely not fully structured)
state pattern for ui display of item
state is used with boolean flags
dictionary
text interpolation 

courtyard: mainly text based.
global variable states (money counters lock/unlocked)
booleans
state machine time

KIND OF chain of responsibility/event manager? but tbh its really just lots of renpy dependence and if and else statements.
