-------------------
notes
pattern that ive used 

state pattern:
the reason and how my code implicitly use the state pattern 
is because it uses counters to track rather they already interacted with the room yet or not
this is done through 2 ways, the forst way is when i used a boolean system to check if they interacted with mia or theo
and the second is through a counter system.

factory pattern for the rooms (done)

singleton(ish)
